# s3Bucket_simpleETL
ETL process by aws opendataset and parsPack(provider) s3 bucket object storage.

It just is a simple etl rpocess to read objects(csv files) from aws opendataset( you can find another datasets) and simple transforamtion it then upload it a s3 bucket for any s3 object storage from any provider not just amazon aws.

I practice this from a course named "Udemy_Writing_production-ready_ETL_pipelines_in_Python_Pandas_2022-4", The data that used in the course not accessible then i use another data.
